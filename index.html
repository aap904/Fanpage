        <p>Welcome to my fanpage. </p>
        <p>Here you can find some information about my favorite video game series : Dark Souls</p>

        <p>I like this game series for its originality and changes to the simple "knight vs supernatural beast" formula followed by games of this genre.</p>
        <p>The gameplay is also very original, as it intertwines the player's actions makes into the overall environment</p>
        <p>The games are also very challenging, which is something I enjoy in video games.</p>
